This is a 67keys keyboard by shelz
(Still working on it)

My keyboard has a closer 1.25U backspace which is near to the key P, one function key (fn2) is set by the left of the backspace key that has not input without other keys or lock to another layout such as coleman layout by the function 1 key
The original 2U backspace became "[" and "]".



The basic purpose is to reduce the way that the finger could access the backspace easier but keep the keycaps options be the same as the normal 64 keyboard.
