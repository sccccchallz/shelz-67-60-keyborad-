This is a 67keys keyboard by shelz
(Still working on it)


The basic purpose is to reduce the way that the finger could access the backspace easier but keep the keycaps options be the same as the normal 64 keyboard.


My keyboard has a closer 1.25U backspace which is near to the key P, one function key (fn2) is set by the left of the backspace key that has not input without other keys or lock to another layout such as coleman layout by the function 1 key. Therefore, the place of original 2U backspace became "[" and "]".
(you could defintely switch to the defualt 64 layout with double 1U backspace and 1U'[', 1.25'U'] and the 1.25U'\')

Well, I am a brake spacebar lover lol.
And due to my IME typing chinese does not require the numbers, I was trying to design the 40%, however, my mom and gf is still using the traditional IMEï¼ŒI switched to 60%, If you are from the English speaking contry, you could just delete the first row and switch tab to esc, the tab could use the fn2 to type in, this is why I put the fn2 to the left of the backspace, one is to reduce the typo on the backspace, one is for the easier access to the function key.

Here is my special layout.




Thanks to the KLE and KFB for helping me design my own layout more easily.
